                    <p>
                        Hi!, My name is Kartikey Gupta and I am 2nd year student at ABES engineering college, Ghaziabad persuing B.TECH from Computer Science branch.
                        I was born and raised in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. I have done my schooling from Saraswati Vidya Mandir Inter College. I have always been crazy 
                        about cars. I am in love with them.
                    </p>
                    <div class="color">
                    <p>
                        I gain interest in programming when I was in 10th standarad. At that time basic HTML is introduced in our syllabus. And I really Loved it.
                        But I can't continue to improve my programming skills because of board exams and further entrance exams pressure. But, Now I am working on my
                        coding skills and I also earn 4-STAR at Hackerrank platform in Python.
                    </p>

                        I am fond of listening music. I also like to play cricket, volleyball and chess also.
                        I want to become a gamer. That's why I am playing lot off multiplayer games like BGMI etc.
